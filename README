SVG::Parser version 1.01
12 March 2006

SVG::Parser is an XML parser that converts SVG XML documents into SVG objects
that may then be manipulated by the SVG module before being regenerated into
XML.  It will work using any installed Expat or SAX parser, and may be given
preferred list of parsers to try; the first to load successfully will be used.
For more advanced uses, any custom Expat or SAX parser class can also be
provided as the superclass XML parser for SVG::Parser.

For documentation and examples, please see the POD documentation included with
the module, and the examples directory.
