SVG::Parser version 0.97
28 April 2002

SVG::Parser is an XML parser that converts SVG XML documents into SVG objects
that may then be manipulated by the SVG module before being regenerated into
XML.  It will work using any installed Expat or SAX parser, and may be given
preferred list of parsers to try; the first to load successfully will be used.

For documentation and examples, please see the POD documentation included with
the module, and the examples directory.
